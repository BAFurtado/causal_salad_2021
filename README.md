# This is a fork of the original work
#### I'll use it to learn basic R (to complement python when needed)
#### If I have time, I may try to convert causal_salad, the code attached to the youtube presentation (link below) into Python.
#### These are just some notes as I read along Rethinking Statistical.


# causal_salad_2021
One day course on causal inference, MPI-EVA 9 September 2021

## Outline

Intro: Foundations of causal inference
Part 1: Inadequacy of ordinary statistical procedures
Part 2: Causal design with structural causal models
Part 3: Bayesian causal inference

There is nothing special to prepare ahead of time. Paper and pencil will be useful for the in-class exercises.

## Slides
The slides are divided into three parts, due to the size of the files. You should download the files, rather than try to view them in your browser.

## Code examples
The code for the examples in the lecture are found in the R script.

## Recording
The presentation was recorded and is available here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNPYUVmY3NM
